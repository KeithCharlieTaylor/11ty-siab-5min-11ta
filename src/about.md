## About Learning 11ta Introduction
_About Learning 11ta_ tells you why I am creating this website and how you can get the most from it. So it describes _Learning 11ta_ site. But it deliberately tells you very little about actually learning 11ta. Because that is in the rest of the website.

In WordPress I would have an 'About Site' page with sub-pages for Purpose, Privacy, Terms, Contact, Navigation, Notifications and any other 'admin pages'.

In a learning project such as this, I would often include a Roadmap. Which I will add later. But for now, I'll use the Roadmap Section below.

## About Learning 11ta
This is my site for learning how to adapt, use and understand 11ta - [Shane Robinson's 11ty | TailwindCSS | Alpine.js Template](https://github.com/11ta/11ta-template/). So I have lots to learn about Eleventy, Tailwind, and Alpine. Furthermore, I want to integrate Speedlify and I know little about GitHub, Netlify, or Javascript. Which is why I'm prepared yo start anew if I realize this is a bad way to start.

I'm hoping to have transferred at least one website from WordPress by the end of February 2021. Because I need the speed benefits ASAP. Also, I want to change my WordPress hosting contract before January 2022. 

One solution would be to document all the features I need then research how to provide an appropriate Eleventy configuration. But I'm overwhelmed by the choices. So I need to see how different features work in practice. Then I can understand if there is a better starting point. Afterall, it's taken me many months of dabbling to assume that Eleventy is the best choice for me. Therefore, I will do the research as I progress here.

### Opinions About 11ta and its Dependencies

<dl id="">
<dt id="images">The best way to include Images in 11ta</dt><dd>I'm assuming my standard 640x400 is good here. Also assuming I should keep them in `/src/assets/images/`. At this stage, I can't see any advantage to subfolders. Except to keep site images in `/src/assets/images/branding/`. I'll explore this more when I review /2020/09/06/featured-post-images/ in more detail. Especially to review workflow with respect to naming, renaming, and captioning.</dd>
